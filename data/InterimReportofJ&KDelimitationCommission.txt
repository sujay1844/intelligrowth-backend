	3⁄4  The delimitation exercise is carried out by an independent high-powered panel known as the Delimitation Commission whose orders have the force of law and cannot be questioned by any court.  
	3⁄4  The exercise has been carried out over the years to redefine the area of a constituency-based on its population size (based on the last Census).  
	3⁄4  Aside from changing the limits of a constituency, the process may result in change in the number of seats in a state.

	3⁄4  Under Article 170, States also get divided into territorial constituencies as per Delimitation Act after every Census.  
	3⁄4  Once the Act is in force, the Union government sets up a Delimitation Commission.  
 The delimitation commission is an independent body constituted under Article 82 after the Parliament enacted a Delimitation Act after every census. 
	3⁄4  However, the first delimitation exercise was carried out by the President (with the help of the Election Commission) in 1950-51.   The Delimitation Commission Act was enacted in 1952.  
	3⁄4  Delimitation Commissions had been set up four times — 1952, 1963, 1973 and 2002 under the Acts of 1952, 1962, 1972 and 2002.   There was no delimitation after the 1981 and 1991 Censuses.  Who is Included in a Delimitation Commission?  
3⁄4 The Delimitation Commission is appointed by the President of India and works in collaboration with the Election Commission of India. 
3⁄4 Composition:  Retired Supreme Court judge  Chief Election Commissioner  Respective State Election Commissioners. 
Why is Delimitation Needed? 
	3⁄4  The uneven growth of population in different constituencies in different parts of the country as well as within the same state.  
	3⁄4  Also, continuous migration of people / electorate from one place to another especially from rural areas to urban areas have resulted in strikingly different sizes of electoral constituencies even within the same State.  What are the Issues with Delimitation?  
	3⁄4  States that take little interest in population control could end up with a greater number of seats in Parliament. The southern states that promoted family planning faced the possibility of having their seats reduced.  
	3⁄4  In 2002-08, Delimitation was done based on the 2001 census, but the total number of seats in the Assemblies and Parliament decided as per the 1971 Census was not changed.  
	3⁄4  The Constitution has also capped the number of Lok Shaba & Rajya Sabha seats to a maximum of 550 &  
250 respectively and increasing populations are being represented by a single representative.
